📊 Data Analysis Project
🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow. It involves loading and exploring a dataset using Python, performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), executing SQL queries using relational databases, and visualizing insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The project concludes with a detailed analytical report and presentation.

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them in a clear, business-friendly format.
